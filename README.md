# Lung Cancer Prediction using Decision Tree

This project was developed as part of the **BSc (Hons) in Data Science** program at **NSBM Green University**.  
The objective is to build a machine learning model for **early detection of lung cancer risk levels** using patient data.

## üìå Project Overview
Lung cancer remains one of the most critical health challenges worldwide.  
This project leverages a **Decision Tree Classifier** to analyze medical and lifestyle factors such as:
- Demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Medical history
- Smoking habits
- Lifestyle and occupational hazards
- Genetic markers

By preprocessing the dataset, performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and applying **Decision Tree classification**, we aim to predict lung cancer risk levels (**Low, Medium, High**) with high accuracy.
